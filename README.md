# Introduction

This is a React Starter Project for use in Stephen Grider's courses on Udemy.
a project on Navigation and Routing that will span multiple sections. We are starting out with the very basics which is the initial styling. Then, we will address the required state and events systems. Everything we are doing builds up to section 13 where we actually start working on the routing.
